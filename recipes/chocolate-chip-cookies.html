        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A chocolate chip cookie is a drop cookie that features chocolate chips or chocolate morsels as its distinguishing ingredient. Chocolate chip cookies are claimed to have originated in the United States in 1938, when Ruth Graves Wakefield chopped up a Nestlé semi-sweet chocolate bar and added the chopped chocolate to a cookie recipe; however, historical recipes for grated or chopped chocolate cookies exist prior to 1938 by various other authors.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup brown sugar packed</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 F.</li>
            <li>Microwave the butter for about 40 seconds. Butter should be completely melted but shouldn't be hot.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix butter with the sugars until well-combined.</li>
            <li>Stir in vanilla and egg until incorporated.</li>
            <li>Add the flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
            <li>Mix dough until just combined. Dough should be soft and a little sticky but not overly sticky.</li>
            <li>Stir in chocolate chips.</li>
            <li>Scoop out 1.5 tablespoons of dough (medium cookie scoop) and place 2 inches apart on baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake for 7-10 minutes, or until cookies are set. They will be puffy and still look a little underbaked in the middle.</li>
        </ol>
