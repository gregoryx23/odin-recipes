            <li>Spread 1 cup of the meat sauce in a 9x13 pan or casserole dish. Top it with 3 lasagna noodles. Layer with ⅓ of the ricotta cheese mixture and 1 cup of meat sauce. Repeat twice more. Finish with 3 noodles topped with remaining sauce.</li>
            <li>Cover with foil and bake for 45 minutes. </li>
